      <h1>Hehehehe, I knew it!  (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠)</h1>
      <p>from the moment you walked into my life, everything just felt... right...... i swear, i'll never get bored of you...... your words, your random thoughts, your smiles...... all of it...... i want to be the reason behind those smiles...... and the one who stays, no matter what......

so, will you let me be that person...... the one who makes you laugh a little harder...... and feel a lot more loved every single day......?</p>
